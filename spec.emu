    <h1>Array.prototype.groupBy ( _callbackfn_ [ , _thisArg_ ] )</h1>
    <emu-note>
      <p>_callbackfn_ should be a function that accepts three arguments. `groupBy` calls _callbackfn_ once for each element in the array, in ascending order, and constructs a new object of arrays. Each value returned by _callbackfn_ is coerced to a property key, and the associated element is included in the array in the constructed object according to this property key.</p>
      <p>If a _thisArg_ parameter is provided, it will be used as the *this* value for each invocation of _callbackfn_. If it is not provided, *undefined* is used instead.</p>
      <p>_callbackfn_ is called with three arguments: the value of the element, the index of the element, and the object being traversed.</p>
      <p>`groupBy` does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the object may be mutated by the calls to _callbackfn_.</p>
      <p>The range of elements processed by `groupBy` is set before the first call to _callbackfn_. Elements which are appended to the array after the call to `groupBy` begins will not be visited by _callbackfn_. If existing elements of the array are changed their value as passed to _callbackfn_ will be the value at the time `groupBy` visits them; elements that are deleted after the call to `groupBy` begins and before being visited are still visited and are either looked up from the prototype or are *undefined*.</p>
      <p>The return value of `groupBy` is an object that does not inherit from _Object.prototype_.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <p>When the `groupBy` method is called with one or two arguments, the following steps are taken:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Let _O_ be ? ToObject(*this* value).
      1. Let _len_ be ? LengthOfArrayLike(_O_).
      1. If IsCallable(_callbackfn_) is *false*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
      1. Let _k_ be 0.
      1. Let _groups_ be a new empty List.
      1. Repeat, while _k_ &lt; _len_
        1. Let _Pk_ be ! ToString(𝔽(_k_)).
        1. Let _kValue_ be ? Get(_O_, _Pk_).
        1. Let _propertyKey_ be ? ToPropertyKey(? Call(_callbackfn_, _thisArg_, &laquo; _kValue_, 𝔽(_k_), _O_ &raquo;)).
        1. Perform ! AddValueToKeyedGroup(_groups_, _propertyKey_, _kValue_).
        1. Set _k_ to _k_ + 1.
      1. Let _obj_ be ! OrdinaryObjectCreate(*null*).
      1. For each Record { [[Key]], [[Elements]] } _g_ of _groups_, do

      <p>The `groupBy` function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its *this* value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.</p>
